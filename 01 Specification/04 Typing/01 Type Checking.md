Lodge is a type type-safe language, meaning that all type checks occur statically at compile time and that no operation can cause a type error at runtime. However, unlike other statically typed languages, Lodge's type system allows more type flexibility while still ensuring type safety.


This means that the Lodge type checker is somewhat complex to match the complexity of the type system.
