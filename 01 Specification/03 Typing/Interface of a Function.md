The interface of a function for the purposes of defining variables is an interface only containing the calling operator method.
```
!! The syntax doesn't exist for defining this as a generic, but here is an example
interface function {
	fun () ReturnType(args ...)
}
```

## Type Operations on Function Types
### Type Unions / Interface Intersection
* The return type is the union of all return types

* Iterate over the functions' shared positional arguments. For each argument:
	* Names are ignored
	* The type is the type intersection of all the types
	* If at least one is required, the resulting argument is required
* If one function has more arguments than another
	* If any of the following arguments are required
		* The functions with fewer arguments must have a positional capture compatible with all required extra arguments, otherwise reject
	* These arguments don't make it into the new signature
		* Unless the functions missing it have compatible positional captures
	
* For each keyword argument in all signatures
	* If the argument is not in all signatures
		* If any argument is required
			* Functions missing this argument must have a keyword capture compatible with it, otherwise reject
		* These arguments don't make it into the new signature
			* Unless the functions missing it have compatible keyword captures
	* The type is the intersection of all the types 
	* If at least one is required, the argument is required

* Positional captures
	* The name is ignored
	* The type is a list of the type intersection of the types of the values being captured

* Keyword captures captures
	* The name is ignored
	* The type is a dictionary
		* keys are strings
		* values are the type intersection of the types of the values being captured
### Type Intersections / Interface Union
* The return types must all have the exact same interface

* Iterate over the functions' shared positional arguments. For each argument:
	* Names are ignored
	* The optionality of all corresponding positional arguments must match, otherwise reject
	* The type is the type union of all the types
* If one function has more arguments than another
	* Reject unless the functions missing it have a compatible positional capture
	* They must all be optional, otherwise reject
	
* For each keyword argument in all signatures
	* If the argument is not in all signatures
		* Reject unless the functions missing it have a compatible keyword capture
		* They must all be optional, otherwise reject
	* The optionality of all corresponding keyword arguments must match, otherwise reject
	* The type is the union of all the types 

* Positional captures
	* The name is ignored
	* If one has a positional capture, they both must, otherwise reject
	* The type is a list of the type union of the types of the values being captured

* Keyword captures captures
	* The name is ignored
	* If one has a keyword capture, they both must, otherwise reject
	* The type is a dictionary
		* keys are strings
		* values are the type union of the types of the values being captured
