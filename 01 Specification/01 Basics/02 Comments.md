## Comments
Comments are created with the `!!` token. Everything after the `!!` until the next newline will be considered a comment and completely ignored.

Multiline comments can be created with `!-` and `-!`. Everything between these two tokens will be ignored as comments. Such comments may also exist on only one line, and code before and after the comment will be treated normally.
