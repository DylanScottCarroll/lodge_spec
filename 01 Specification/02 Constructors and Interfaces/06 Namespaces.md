Speculation:
I may want it to be possible to bind fields and methods with "classes". Though, because the concept of class is missing from lodge it is unclear if these would be bound to a constructor or the interface. Binding them with constructors is problematic because constructors, essentially being functions, have no fields. It would be interesting to allow functions to have fields, but that makes interface set operations more complex. 

Instead, I think it may be simpler just not to allow that sort of thing and instead use package namespaces and such to acieve similar results.
