The code format used by [[Lodge Intermediate Format (.lift)|.lift]]


## Philosophy

Most likely a bytecode format of a lower-level representation of Lodge code.

It will have all symbol names and type information preserved in order to allow further compilation with other .lift files

I want it to be a good target for interpretation as well as further compilation as I believe an interpreter backend will be a simpler than the compiler backend
