Stored in `*.lift` files (Lodge Intermediate FormaT)


LIFT *files* are a **cross-platform** mid-level representation of Lodge code intended to hold, in a minimal representation, all of the information required to compile the final program.

Each LIFT file represents a subset or entirety of a Lodge program. Lodge source code files can be compiled into lift files, and LIFT files can be merged together into a single a single file. This merging process is where external references and interface resolutions occur.



## Merging LIFT files
The specifics of this process are still foggy.
