#lodge_implementation

In theory, lodge Strings should have support for many various text-encoding schemes like ascii, ISO 8859, and utf-8, but that will probably come later.

The first few versions will probably only support ascii/ISO8859 strings.

I see no reason, however, not to support all of those things in the compiler, so lodge code will be able to be written in several encodings.
