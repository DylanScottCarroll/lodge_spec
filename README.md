This is the specification for the (WIP) Lodge Programming language.

Lodge is in the very early stages of development and likely will be for some time. This spec so far consists of the details that must be ironed out before implementation can continue. What is here is subject to change as technical decisions are made. Additionally, this spec has undergone and will continue to undergo a number of partial revisions and is as such inconsistent and lacking detail in some places. Section 01 is the only part of this spec that is approaching reasonably complete. Section 02 consists mostly of notes and ideas at this point in time.

The implementation for an eventual compiler for lodge has started in [this repository](https://github.com/DylanScottCarroll/lodge).
