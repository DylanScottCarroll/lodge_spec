This is the specification for the (WIP) Lodge Programming language.

Note that this spec has undergone and will continue to undergo a number of partial revisions and is as such inconsistent and lacking detail in many places. What currently exists is not complete and many sections still need to be revised and expanded. As implementation work on the interpreter/compiler continues, this specification will be updated to match and vice versa.

The implementation for an eventual compiler for lodge has started in [this repository](https://github.com/DylanScottCarroll/lodge).
