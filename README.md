This is the specification for the (WIP) Lodge Programming language.

Lodge is in the very early stages of development and likely will be for some time. This spec so far consists of the details that must be ironed out before implementation begins at all. What is here is subject to significant change as technical decisions are made. Additionally, this spec has undergone and will continue to undergo a number of partial revisions and is as such inconsistent and lacking detail in many places.

Section 01 is the only part of this spec that is approaching reasonably complete. Section 02 is mostly just ideas and notes, many of which are outdated. Section 03 has not even been started.

The implementation for an eventual compiler for lodge has started in [this repository](https://github.com/DylanScottCarroll/lodge).
