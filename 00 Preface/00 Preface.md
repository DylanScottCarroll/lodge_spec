## Versioning
The versions of the specification and the language consist of three numbers. For the spec version and the language version, the first two numbers of each represent major and minor versions.

Major versions indicate major revisions to the language and large breaking changes.

Minor versions indicate minor revisions and compatibility-preserving changes. 

The third digit of the specification represent sub-minor versions of the specification. These indicate changes to the specification that don't constitute an update to the language. Changes for clarity or organization would be considered sub-minor spec versions.

Likewise, the third digit of the language are sub-minor versions of the language. Sub-minor versions of the language do not reflect changes in the specification and thus do not correspond to new features or changes in behavior. Changes relating to fine implementation details, refactoring, and performance improvements may constitute sub-minor language versions.
