At one point, I lost ~4k words that I had written in these docs. This note is where I wrote the list of topics that I had lost from as best as I could remember it. 

Functions
* Description of function closures
* Generator functions

Classes
* The structure of classes
* The way class methods are stored
	* The closure objects exist at the end of the class 
	* The code exists in the code segment (obviously)
